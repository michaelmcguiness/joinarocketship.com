## Company Overview

Instabase was founded in 2015 when [Anant Bhardwaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anantpb/) abandoned his doctoral work at MIT to start the data solutions company. He noticed an opportunity to serve companies that simply needed an app to scan PDF documents to separate text from images. Today, the company provides a suite of tools and building blocks for pre-packaged apps. They leverage machine learning and natural-language processing to extract documents, draft reports, and integrate internal tools.

> "We don't build custom apps for clients," Anant said, while highlighting how the platform provides a framework for automating the processing of unstructured and offline data. "We (provide) them with the toolkit so that they can do it themselves."

There appears to be a ton of emerging use cases for the software. Instabase use cases range from automating onboarding processes for corporate clients to helping a bank comb through tax documents or scans of pay stubs and bank statments.

Most of the company's customers are in banking and insurance today, but the company plans to expand into new industries, such as healthcare, logistics, government, and telecommunications. Longer term, Anant hopes to build an "operating system for the Internet."

While the goal is certainly ambitious, the opportunity does seem massive. Instabase is going after \$1.2 trillion of digital transformation spend in enterprises, and it sits at the intersection of three of the most hot and transformational software disruptions in the world today: digitization of business processes, low-code/no-code and AI.

## Valuation and Fundraising History

Instabase has raised $132 million in VC financing to date.  Most recently, the company raised $105 million in a Series B led by Index Ventures. Other participants in the round included Greylock, NEA, and Andreessen Horowitz. The round earned Instabase a valuation just north of $1 billion, which roughly eight times the $125 million valuation it reached in 2017.
